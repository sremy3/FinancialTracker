 * class is the onCreate() method which is called when the activity is created.
 * 
 * Every activity has it's own xml file under res/layout which determines what
 * the activity looks like. To change the look of the activity, you change the
 * xml. Other useful things you can find other res include values such as
 * strings you may want to use.
